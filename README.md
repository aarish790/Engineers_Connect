# Quick Start ðŸš€
Add a default.json file in config folder with the following
```
{
  "mongoURI": "<your_mongoDB_Atlas_uri_with_credentials>",
  "jwtSecret": "secret",
  "githubToken": "<yoursecrectaccesstoken>"
}
```
# Install server dependencies
```
npm install
```
# Install client dependencies
```
cd client
npm install
```
# Run both Express & React from root
```
npm run dev
```
# Build for production
```
cd client
npm run build
```
# Test production before deploy
After running a build in the client ðŸ‘†, cd into the root of the project.
And run...

```
NODE_ENV=production node server.js
```
Check in browser on http://localhost:5000/

# Deploy to Heroku
If you followed the sensible advice above and included ```config/default.json``` and ```config/production.json``` in your .gitignore file, then pushing to Heroku will omit your config files from the push.
However, Heroku needs these files for a successful build.
So how to get them to Heroku without commiting them to GitHub?

What I suggest you do is create a local only branch, lets call it production.

```
git checkout -b production
```
We can use this branch to deploy from, with our config files.

Add the config file...

```
git add -f config/production.json
```
This will track the file in git on this branch only. 
#### DON'T PUSH THE PRODUCTION BRANCH TO GITHUB

Commit...

```
git commit -m 'ready to deploy'
```
Create your Heroku project

```
heroku create
```
And push the local production branch to the remote heroku master branch.

```
git push heroku production:master
```
Now Heroku will have the config it needs to build the project.

#### Don't forget to make sure your production database is not whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas, otherwise the 
#### database connection will fail and your app will crash.

After deployment you can delete the production branch if you like.
```
git checkout master
git branch -D production
```
Or you can leave it to merge and push updates from another branch.
Make any changes you need on your master branch and merge those into your production branch.
```
git checkout production
git merge master
```
Once merged you can push to heroku as above and your site will rebuild and be updated.
